\chapter{Lattices}
I think of lattices like discrete linear algebra. 
It doesn't have to be integers. for instance, $\sqrt{2}\cdot \mathbb{Z}^2$, is a valid lattice.
\todo{take the following and grab what you need from it: https://advancedcrypto.github.io/Lecture2.pdf}

Throughout, we treat all vectors as column vectors unless otherwise specified.

\begin{definition}[lattices]
    Given $n$ \bf{linearly independent} vectors $b_1,\dots, b_n\in \mathbb{R}^m$, the lattice generated by them is defined as
$$ 
\mathcal{L}(b_1,\dots, b_n) = \{\sum{x_i \cdot b_i} | x_i \in \mathbb{Z} \}
$$
    
and we call $b_1,\dots, b_n$ its \emph{basis}.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
We say that $n$ (the number of vectors in the basis) is the \emph{rank} of the lattice, and $m$ (from $\mathbb{R}^m$) is the \emph{dimension} of the lattice.
In addition, if $n=m$ it is considered \emph{full rank}.
\end{definition}

We discuss mainly full-rank lattices.


We will use a notational short-hand when dealing with bases, letting a matrix $B$ whose columns are $b_1,\dots, b_n$ the basis vectors denote a lattice basis. That is, we will write

$$ \mathbf{B}=\left(\begin{matrix}| &  & |\\
\mathbf{b_{1}} & \dots & \mathbf{b_{n}}\\
| &  & |
\end{matrix}\right) 
$$

\section{Same Lattice, Many Bases}

The same lattice can have many different bases (as in classical linear algebra)
For example, it turns out that all the bases given below generate the same 
lattice

$$ 
B_{1}=\left(\begin{matrix}1 & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{matrix}\right)\text{ and }B_{2}=\left(\begin{matrix}2 & 1\\
1 & 1
\end{matrix}\right)
$$


A natural question to ask is: how can we efficiently tell if two given bases $B$ and $b'$ generate the same lattice?
We will give two answers to this question - an algebraic answer and a geometric answer.

\subsection{An Algebraic and Geometric Characterization using Unimodular Matrices}
Our first characterization provides an efficient algorithm to determine if two bases generate the same
lattice. In order to present the characterization, we first need to define the notion of a unimodular matrix.


\begin{definition}
    A matrix $U\in \mathbb{Z}^{n\times n}$ is \emph{unimodular} if $| \det{U} |=1$ (the absolute value of the determinante of $U$).
\end{definition}

for instance, $\left(\begin{matrix}2 & 1\\
1 & 1
\end{matrix}\right)$ is unimodular, but $\left(\begin{matrix}42 & 41\\
    9 & 8
\end{matrix}\right) $.

\begin{proposition}
    If $U$ is unimodular, so is $U^-1$.
\end{proposition}

We can now state the characterization of equivalent bases.

\begin{theorem}
Given two full-rank bases $B,B'\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, the following two conditions are equivalent 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\mathcal{L}(B)=\mathcal{L}(B')$
        \item There exists a unimodular matrix $U$ such that $B=B'U$.
    \end{itemize}

    (Without proof)
\end{theorem}
