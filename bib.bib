abstract="We propose SWIFFT, a collection of compression functions that are highly parallelizable and admit very efficient implementations on modern microprocessors. The main technique underlying our functions is a novel use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to achieve ``diffusion,'' together with a linear combination to achieve compression and ``confusion.'' We provide a detailed security analysis of concrete instantiations, and give a high-performance software implementation that exploits the inherent parallelism of the FFT algorithm. The throughput of our implementation is competitive with that of SHA-256, with additional parallelism yet to be exploited.",

Consensus in the Presence of Partial Synchrony

abstract = {The concept of partial synchrony in a distributed system is introduced. Partial synchrony lies between the cases of a synchronous system and an asynchronous system. In a synchronous system, there is a known fixed upper bound Δ on the time required for a message to be sent from one processor to another and a known fixed upper bound Φ on the relative speeds of different processors. In an asynchronous system no fixed upper bounds Δ and Φ exist. In one version of partial synchrony, fixed bounds Δ and Φ exist, but they are not known a priori. The problem is to design protocols that work correctly in the partially synchronous system regardless of the actual values of the bounds Δ and Φ. In another version of partial synchrony, the bounds are known, but are only guaranteed to hold starting at some unknown time T, and protocols must be designed to work correctly regardless of when time T occurs. Fault-tolerant consensus protocols are given for various cases of partial synchrony and various fault models. Lower bounds that show in most cases that our protocols are optimal with respect to the number of faults tolerated are also given. Our consensus protocols for partially synchronous processors use new protocols for fault-tolerant “distributed clocks” that allow partially synchronous processors to reach some approximately common notion of time.},

	abstract = {A new algorithm is developed for decoding Reed-Solomon codes. It uses fast Fourier transforms and computes the message symbols directly without explicitly finding error locations or error magnitudes. In the decoding radius (up to half of the minimum distance), the new method is easily adapted for error and erasure decoding. It can also detect all errors outside the decoding radius. Compared with the BerlekampMassey algorithm, discovered in the late 1960's, the new method seems simpler and more natural yet it has a similar time complexity.},
