abstract="We propose SWIFFT, a collection of compression functions that are highly parallelizable and admit very efficient implementations on modern microprocessors. The main technique underlying our functions is a novel use of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to achieve ``diffusion,'' together with a linear combination to achieve compression and ``confusion.'' We provide a detailed security analysis of concrete instantiations, and give a high-performance software implementation that exploits the inherent parallelism of the FFT algorithm. The throughput of our implementation is competitive with that of SHA-256, with additional parallelism yet to be exploited.",
